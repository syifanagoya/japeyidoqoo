It all began when these two young hearts crossed paths in 2016. The sparks flew, and they started dating not long after. Their love blossomed, and in October 2017, Joe Jonas popped the question with a stunning engagement ring.</p><p>What followed was nothing short of a whirlwind romance. In May 2019, the couple surprised us all with a spontaneous Las Vegas wedding. It was a fun and intimate ceremony, complete with an Elvis impersonator, capturing the hearts of fans worldwide. Later that summer, they celebrated their love with a more traditional wedding ceremony in France, surrounded by family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-081723-1-d4dc15130d884798bdffcea2bec09d51-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Building_a_Family_Together></span><strong>Building a Family Together</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe and Sophie’s journey took another beautiful turn when they welcomed their first daughter, Willa, in July 2020.
