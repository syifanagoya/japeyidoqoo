Recently, Cargill was seen training with Natalya.</p><p><a href=#>Cargill</a> was one of the stars who made a name for herself in All Elite Wrestling. She was the inaugural and the longest-reigning TBS Champion. Throughout her entire run in the Jacksonville-based promotion, she only lost to one wrestler, Kris Statlander.</p><p>In early 2023, Cargill signed with WWE. Since then she has <a href=#>shown her face in a couple of Premium Live Events</a> and also has popped on SmackDown and NXT a few times.</p><p>Recently, WWE veteran Natalya posted on her Instagram story of a training session taking place in the Hart Dungeon. One of the stars training there was Jade Cargill.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-jade-cargill-on-which-brand-she-would-debut-in>Jade Cargill on which brand she would debut in</h2><p>A few weeks ago, Cargill was interviewed by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dallas Morning News</a>. During the interview, she was asked which brand she would make her debut in. The former TBS Champion <a href=#>didn’t want to reveal anything</a> and also asked for the fans to be patient and claimed that WWE is setting her up for success.</p><p>“So, you want me to reveal what we have in the works it seems like,” Jade Cargill said. “[Laughs] So, listen, I think the fan base should be patient. I think they need to understand we’re making a diamond. We’re creating something that’s gonna be a legacy. We’re creating something that’s going to create echoes and waves throughout not just the wrestling culture, but pop culture and beyond. They’re setting me up for success, you shouldn’t rush success.</p><p>“I’ve been on TV in front of thousands of people several times, one thing I know how to do is entertain a crowd. And no one — no one — can say different. I can do that. The WWE Universe knows exactly what they’re doing. I trust them. I believe in this system. And when they see me in that ring, understand, there’s no turning back. [WWE]’s believing in everything I’m doing, given me everything that I could fathom. And I’m going to be ready. I’m already ready. But again, it’s on my time, and everybody should be patient. And when I come, just understand I’m taking over.”</p><p>Cargill also mentioned that she is open to wrestling anyone in the Stamford-based promotion.</p><p>“You’ll just have to see. Just know when I start there’s no stopping,” Cargill said. “There’s no breaks and everybody should be elated. So whomever wants to come get it, I got it. I’m just gonna give out work. Come apply.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsa2ttZGK3orDEZpqaqpeeua1506uYoqaZo7Ruw8itn2amkamurcXAZpitZaSdsm6w1Keenqee</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-simple-simons-daughter-keeley-colbran.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Simple Simon's Daughter, Keeley Colbran?
