Stephen Stills is best known for his work with the bands Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Buffalo Springfield. With the latter, he composed such hit songs as "For What It's Worth," "Bluebird," and "Rock & Roll Woman." Stills has also had a successful solo career, with the single "Love the One You're With" being his biggest hit.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Stephen Stills was born on January 3, 1945 in Dallas, Texas to William and Talitha. Brought up in a military family, he frequently moved as a child to places including Florida, Louisiana, Costa Rica, and El Salvador. For his education, Stills went to Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida, and then to Saint Leo College Preparatory School. He eventually graduated from Lincoln High School in Costa Rica. Stills subsequently attended Louisiana State University, but dropped out in the early 60s.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Stills began his musical career playing in a number of bands, including the Continentals. He also sang as a solo performer at the Greenwich Village coffeehouse Gerde's Folk City. Stills went on to become part of the house act at New York City's Cafe au Go Go; with this group, he did some touring, and released an album in 1964. Following this, he formed the band the Company with four other members of the Au Go Go Singers.</p><h2 id=buffalo-springfield><strong>Buffalo Springfield</strong></h2><p>With <a href=#>Neil Young</a> and former bandmate <a href=# title="Richie Furay Net Worth">Richie Furay</a>, Stills formed the band Buffalo Springfield in Los Angeles in 1966. The band specialized in a mix of folk, rock, country, and psychedelia, and released its self-titled debut album the same year as its formation. From the album, Stills' song "For What It's Worth" became a significant hit, peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967. Later that year, Buffalo Springfield released its second album, "Buffalo Springfield Again"; it featured the songs "Bluebird" and "Rock & Roll Woman." Although the band officially broke up in the spring of 1968, contractual obligations required the creation of a final album, which became "Last Time Around."</p><h2 id=crosby-stills-nash-amp-young><strong>Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young</strong></h2><p>Late in 1968, Stills joined the Byrds' <a href=#>David Crosby</a> and the Hollies' <a href=# title="Graham Nash Net Worth">Graham Nash</a> to form the folk rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash. The band's self-titled debut album came out the following year; a substantial success, it spawned the top-40 hits "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" and "Marrakesh Express." Aiming to go on tour and realizing they needed more musicians to strengthen their sound, Crosby, Stills & Nash decided to invite Neil Young to join them, ultimately creating the quarter Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. In 1970, they released the album "DÃ©jÃ  Vu," which launched the top-40 singles "Woodstock," "Our House," and "Teach Your Children." The following year, CSNY released the double live album "4 Way Street," which reached number one on the Billboard 200. However, the tour that produced the album was a tumultuous one, marked by many arguments between Young and drummer Dallas Taylor and tensions with Stills. When the tour was over, CSNY split up. The group got back together a number of times over the years, and released such further albums as "So Far," "CSN," "Daylight Again," "American Dream," "After the Storm," and "Looking Forward."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226955 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Stephen-Stills.jpg alt="Stephen Stills Net Worth" width=423 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-226955 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>At the peak of CSNY's success, Stills and the other members of the band recorded solo albums.
