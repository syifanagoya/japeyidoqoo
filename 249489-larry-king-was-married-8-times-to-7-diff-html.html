At 18, he exchanged vows with his young lover, Freda Miller. However, their parents were allegedly not pleased with the new marital development and had the marriage annulled the following year.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ANNETTE KAYE: 1961</strong></p><p class=dh>In yet another eventful marital stint, the Late Larry King found love once again in the arms of Annette Kaye in 1961. Although the marriage did not last for up to a year, the former couple welcomed King’s first child, Larry Jr., that same year.</p><p class=dh>King reportedly did not meet Larry Jr. until he was in his 30s. According to reports, Kaye gave birth to their son after they already parted ways.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALENE AKINS: 1961-1963</strong></p><p class=dh>Not a man to waste time brooding, King went on to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/larry-kings-7-ex-wives-divorce>tie the knot</a> with the third of his seven wives, former Playboy Bunny, Alene Akins; they would get married again later in the future.
