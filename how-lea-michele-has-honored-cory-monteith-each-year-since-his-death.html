Whether she writes a heartfelt note or shares a sweet throwback photo, she does not let the day pass without honoring him.</p><p>The Monte Carlo star died at age 31 of an accidental mixed drug toxicity, involving heroin and alcohol. He was found in a Vancouver, Canada, hotel in July 2013. The actor completed a stay in rehab months prior to his death.</p><p>Michele and Monteith, who played Rachel Berry and Finn Hudson, respectively, on&nbsp;Glee, met on set in 2009. The pair dated from 2012 until his death.</p><p>The&nbsp;Scream Queens&nbsp;alum remembered her late beau with multiple tattoos. She <a href=#>inked his character’s jersey number on her side</a> in April 2016, writing on Instagram at the time, “And one more.. for my Quarterback.. #5.” The actress also <a href=#>had “Finn” written on her lower back</a>.</p><p>Michele opened up about the couple’s previous plans for the future in February 2014. “We talked about a lot of things. We <a href=#>talked about children</a> and what we would look like when we grew old, and who would be fat and how we would stay thin,” she recalled to&nbsp;Glamour UK. “We talked about where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do. We were done. We were it.”</p><p>She added: “When you’re at that place in your life with someone, you talk about everything. But today I feel like I was given the best part of Cory, and I’m thankful for that.”</p><p>Later that year, Michele gushed about her romance with Monteith and defended his memory. “I only have happy memories of Cory. He <a href=#>was not his addiction</a> — unfortunately, it won,” she told&nbsp;Seventeen. “But that wasn’t who he was. Cory made me feel like a queen every day. From the minute he said, ‘I’m your boyfriend,’ I loved every day, and I thank him for being the best boyfriend and making me feel so beautiful.”</p><p>Looking back on her time filming with the late actor still makes Michele “emotional,” she revealed on a January 2020 episode of the “Showmance” podcast with <a href=#><strong>Kevin McHale</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jenna Ushkowitz</strong></a>, who also starred on Glee.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“<a href=#>The moments that made me so emotional</a> were not anything that ever has made me emotional before about the show,” she explained after rewatching the series pilot. “One of them was when [Finn] took [Artie] out of the Porta Potty. There were so many moments that you see the whole arc of a character for a whole season in one moment. Him taking you out of the bathroom, and you see Finn’s heart. Oh, my God.”</p><p>Scroll to see the songstress’ tributes to her late boyfriend through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktbDDjKWcmmWdnrCpscueZKGZo2K1sLrOq5ydZZOkv7p5zKilrZ2ZqbVuscCcn2axlZa%2Fbr%2FIp5qeZZiewG6wxJqroWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-majewski-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love Majewski Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./428318-carly-pearce-matthew-west-truth-be-told.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lyrics &amp;amp; Translations of Truth Be Told by Carly Pearce &amp;amp; Matthew West</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mablean-ephriam-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Mablean Ephriam Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shaved-fennel-and-crushed-olive-salad.html>shaved fennel and crushed olivesalad</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-boyes-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Erin Boyes Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-duhamels-buddy-games-cast-revealed-meet-the-6-teams.html>Josh Duhamels Buddy Games Cast Revealed: Meet the 6 Teams</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reba-mcentire-recites-meredith-marks-you-can-leave-rant.html>Reba McEntire Recites Meredith Marks You Can Leave Rant</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
