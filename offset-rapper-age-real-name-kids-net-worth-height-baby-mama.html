The group became famed after their debut single&nbsp;<i>Versace</i>&nbsp;(2013) went viral and was on No. 99 of the US Billboard 100 chart. His group has since dropped three studio albums and they are gunning for the fourth one. Offset, on the other hand, has one album to his credit whose single <i>Ric Flair Drip </i>got 3 times platinum while banging the charts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=offset-%e2%80%93-bio-age-real-name></span><strong>Offset – Bio, Age, Real Name</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Offset is an African-American whose birth name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus and was born on December 14, 1991, in Lawrenceville, but raised in Gwinnett County, Georgia, USA. The names of his parents and their occupation are not known, however, he was raised solely by his aunt alongside his cousin, Takeoff.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>He schooled at Berkmar High School in Lilburn, Georgia, where he graduated from in 2009 – which is also where he co-formed <i>Migos</i>. During his high school days, he played football until he sustained an injury that forced him to stop the sports entirely.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Offset co-formed <i>Migos</i> with his close relatives in 2008 when he was still in high school, the first name they adopted was <i>Polo Club</i> before they settled for&nbsp;<i>Migos</i>. Though the single that gave them the much-needed recognition was released in 2013, the group had earlier released their first mixtape titled <i>Juug Season</i> on August 25, 2011, without much acceptance.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Their second mixtape, <i>No Label</i>, assisted by Tucker Toenjes and Mitchell Thomas was released on June 1, 2012, yet, it didn’t give them the needed breakthrough. The year 2013 was a remarkable one for the group following the release of the single Versace which was produced by Zaytoven and peaked at number 99 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The same year, they released another mixtape, <i>Y.R.N (Young Rich Niggas) </i>which had their chart-topping single Versace in the album.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Their debut studio album,&nbsp;Young Rich Nation&nbsp;was released in 2015 and it contained a classic single, <i>Bad and Boujee.</i>&nbsp;The single was said to be Offset’s brain child and it peaked as No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. They followed this up with their 2nd studio album Culture&nbsp;on January 27, 2017. The album was again widely received, debuting at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Rapper Offset has collaborated with other top artists including his wife,&nbsp;Cardi B&nbsp;and his cousin,&nbsp;Quavo. Others are Gucci Mane, Drake,&nbsp;Metro Boomin, Huncho Jack,&nbsp;21 Savage,&nbsp;Future,&nbsp;Young Thug,&nbsp;Lil Yachty.

The album earned him his first Plantinum; Ric Flair Drip a song from the album&nbsp;was 3 times platinum certified by RIAA and it&nbsp;also debuted at number 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart while it topped the US Raps Charts.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Apart from his contributions to the industry, he has also made headlines for negative reasons. He was indicted in a theft case that landed him in Dekalb County prison in 2013. He was later arrested again and charged alongside his group members; Takeoff and Quavo for illegal possession of drugs and firearms in 2015. Offset was found guilty and was remanded in custody for 4 months.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>A part of his lyrics in the song&nbsp;<i>Boss Life</i>&nbsp;which he sang with YFN Lucci brought him under public fire as the lyrics “I cannot vibe with queers” were termed homophobic to which he later extended unreserved apologies to the gay community through his Instagram page.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>With a successful career so far, Offset (rapper) has added himself to the list of millionaire rappers. He and his group members, the <i>Migos</i> are known to move around with lots of cash which they spend at will apart from the many ‘blings’ he wears around his neck.</p><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Aside from various tours and the group and solo records, he launched a cancer campaign in loving memory of his granny, Sallie Ann Smith and they raised $500,000. His current net worth pegged at $16 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life-%e2%80%93-baby-mama-and-kids></span><strong>Personal Life – Baby Mama and Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=yiv0707005205ydpfae9a9cemsonormal>Offset has been linked to many women in the past and a few of them have actually become his baby mamas.
