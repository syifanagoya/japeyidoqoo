This first book introduces its readers to the magical world of Hogwarts, through the eyes of an orphan boy living among humans (or muggles, as they’re called). Almost following the perfect recipe for success, the first book immediately <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shows a relatable and antagonized kid</a>, who wishes to get away from his abusive family and finally reach what he always felt had been lacking in his life.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/harry-potter-and-the-chambers-of-secrets.jpg><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>A year after its debut novel, Harry Potter sees the beloved trio — Harry, Hermione, and Ron — embark on a completely new adventure filled with an arsenal of new magical creatures. This time, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the year once again does not go smoothly for these kids</a>, who are left to solve a new mystery after the school caretaker’s cat is found petrified.

Introducing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a new side of Hogwarts through the prison fugitive Sirius Black</a> and the Dementors, the dark and faceless beings who suck the soul out of their victims, the third book offers a new glimpse into the Harry Potter lore, in a much darker sociopolitical and psychological sense.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire.jpg><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>For many, the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the exact turning point that kept older readers hooked into this changing saga. As the trio returns to Hogwarts for their fourth year of school, the magical grounds are hosting the Triwizard Tournament, which three major wizarding academies are attending and competing in. Hoping for this year to be uneventful for once, Harry is once again put in a tight spot <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when the ceremonial Goblet of Fire selects him as the fourth Triwizard Champion</a>, despite him not being eligible to participate due to his young age.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harry-Potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix.jpg><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book of the saga that revolutionized the magic world of wizardry. By far <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most politically-forward book in the series</a>, Order of the Phoenix revives Voldemort as a threat that has been overlooked by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to take action in fear of public outrage. This lack of action by those in power begs for the creation of an underground group working to dismantle Voldemort and his followers, called Order of the Phoenix.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harry-Potter-and-the-half-blood-prince.jpg><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>The sixth book in the saga is also the penultimate Harry Potter book. As the obvious culminating force that heads to the story’s climax, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Princ<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">e introduces an entirely new side to Voldemort, or Tom Riddle</a>, as Harry sees his past and backstory. Moreover, this book also sees Dumbledore’s new large-scale plan, while he prepares Harry for his imminent and unavoidable battle with the story’s antagonist.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harry-Potter-and-deathly-hallows.jpg><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>The wizarding world comes to an end – until 2016 at least. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows wraps up the saga that allowed an entire generation of teens to connect with their inner wizards. Finally reaching the highly anticipated battle between Voldemort and Harry, the last book is undeniably a perfect ending to any story, obviously carefully planned from the start. Undeniably the darkest book out of the entire saga, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deathly Hallows sees Harry, Hermione, and Ron suffering like never before</a>.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Wrapping up the story of a decade into one book, J.K. Rowling takes this booming story with a perfectly satisfying ending. With hundreds of characters, and thousands of pages, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was seemingly the last possible drop in the saga, but to the surprise of many, one more book came around almost 20 years after the series’ first release.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harry-Potter-and-deathly-hallows-part-2.jpg><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Set nineteen years after the events of Deathly Hallows, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child became an unofficial canon part of the original series, albeit written by John Tiffany and Jack Thorne – though inspired by an original story written by Rowling, Tiffany, and Thorne. This time focused on Harry and Sirius’ kids, Albus and Scorpius, respectively, the Cursed Child picks up exactly where the previous book left off.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>This book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">although technically not canonically part of the series</a>, has been confirmed by Rowling to be exactly the story she envisioned for her original characters. With many fans expectantly waiting for Hogwarts to return, the success of the book was guaranteed. Though it never reached the level of popularity of its original stories, it still received no shortage of hype among the most avid of Potterheads.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter Library Textbooks and Screenplays</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fantastic-beasts.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>In addition to all seven books and Cursed Child, Rowling has given fans one more chance to live out their dream of becoming Hogwarts students.
